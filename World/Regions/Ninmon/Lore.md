- Home to Humans, dwarves, and plenty of nobles

- A civil war has been tearing the country apart for a quarter of a century but none of the sides have gotten anywhere

- The two sides are The Revelation Alliance and The Confederation of Crimson

- The revelation Alliance are a group of poor working class individuals who had enough of mistreatment and decided to rebel.

- Led by a charismatic leader named Borthan djerg, meaning strong dwarf in common. He initiated the conflict by sowing the seeds of rebellion in the dwarves through twisting the truth. He seeks to turn the gods mortal as revenge for turning their back on his kind. Once the gods are mortal, he seeks to kill them. Maybe, if given enough time, he himself will become a god through gaining enough followers.

- The Confederation of Crimson are mainly the noble and elite, people who want to keep the working class under their boot. They mainly see dwarves as an inferior race only meant for mining out mountains.

- The war is named The War of False Promises. SO named due to the upper class breaking their promises to the lower class

- They siphon the power of this dragon and use it for immortality and to create brainwashed super aasmirs. These super aasmirs appear once every 27 years on the anniversary of the dragons capture.

- These super aasmirs are brain washed with the phrase "For our dragon, we serve you"

- This dragon was imprisoned thousands of years ago and has been asleep ever since his imprisonment. His dreams consist of current world events. He is basically a spectator in a world that is moving fast

- The dragon is approaching the end of his life span quickly. His body can only endure so much before it finally gives out

- Colby's angel is a follower of this celestial dragon and wants to desperately save it and communicates to colby through his dreams
