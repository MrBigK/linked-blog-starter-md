- Home to the elves

- The elves here are very stubborn and pretentious

- They have a hierarchy system based on how one looks and whether they're considered beautiful

- The elves are also very reclusive, often hiding away from the outside world and not wanting to have anything to do with it

- The area is lush and full of life

- Very jungly and wet

- The elves keep the corruption from vvarvenheim away by using pure druidic magic

- The oldest civilised part of Iabetis, full of ancient temples, relics, and much more

- Very indiana jonesy

- A Mighty Servant of Leuk-O is hidden somewhere in the area

- TEETH OF DAHLVER-NAR is located in an ancient temple

- Magic mushrooms can be found here due to the lands connection to the fey

- The head of Palli Mankaji is currently being controlled by a Ostiarius who has escaped from the shadow realm. The Ostiarius seeks to merge the plane of shadows with Iabetis, and have the two become one using the power of the portal in Vvarvenheim.

- In Palli Mankajji there lives a colony of leshys who all worship a Green Man that they call Grandfather. Recently, the colony of leshys have been having trouble with the local elf population as they have become more hostile towards nature itself.
