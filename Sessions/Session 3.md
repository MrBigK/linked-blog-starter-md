# Recap
The party successfully defeated the zombies that were overrunning the town and the townsfolk took notice. Johnny tried to give a rousing speech but he sadly missed the mark and couldn't quite land. Its okay though, the townspeople think he's just a little bit retarded. 
It was at this moment a mysterious figure comes across the horizon donning a gold mask, being carried in a palanquin.
