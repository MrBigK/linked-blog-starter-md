# Backstory
The God Hand are the creators of the Iabetis. They created the world alongside The Living Tribunal. From The God Hand, all things corruptible spawned. These are the beings who created the Deck of Many Things. In order to satiate their desire for entertainment, they created this mystical artifact. Viven encountered this artifact many years ago, and brought ruin to the king of Gardmore Abbey. From this encounter, she now corrupts any and all who seek wealth, fame, and power. She herself seeks to become the God Hand. The God Hand would like to prevent The Living Tribunal from discovering Viven, even though it may already be too late.
