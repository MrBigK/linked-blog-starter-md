# Backstory
Long ago, Adore Gavilucci studied at the university in Tibrygg. Through his multitudes of research and time spent perfecting his craft, he soon gained the rank of a high scholar. This allowed him to receive the funding necessary to travel the world in search of artifacts to send back to the University. He soon got word of the land of Dreadmore Isle, a place filled to the brim with cursed beings and things not meant for the human eye. When he arrived to this island to discover the cause, he was greeted by Count Brudevich, a charming individual who welcomed Adore with open arms into this land. 
Count Brudevich and Adore soon became close friends, discussing the things of this world when Adore noticed Brudevich was in possesion of a Behlit, an object of immense power. Adore told Brudevich he has to get rid of it immediately and that Adore has to take it back to the university. A fight soon broke out and both of the individuals blood spilled onto the behlit, awakening it and contacting the God Hand. Adore Managed to push Brudevich out of the area before he was transported, but it left Adore there to keep the plane open and to make sure Brudevich never gets his hands on it.

His time in the realm of the God Hand has corrupted his blood and his mind, though that hint of good is still there in the back of his mind, waiting to be released.
